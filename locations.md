# Dimensions of MCU Cover:

$(119 - 78.62) \times (78 - 58.51)$
= $40.38 \times 19.49$ ... plus I need the extra loop for the third mounting hole

... Of course, I need to identify the locations of the mounting holes very carefully.... Here they are relative to the bottom left corner of the cover:

MH #1: $(61.18 - 58.51) \times (119 - 115.83) =  2.67 \times  3.17$

MH #2: $(76.42 - 58.51) \times (119 - 115.83) = 17.91 \times  3.17$

MH #3: $(79.69 - 58.51) \times (119 -  80.34) = 21.18 \times 38.66$

# Things to Check

What spacing between keys do I want? Should I make it all for choc keycaps, or should I allow the use of DSA keycaps? ... How much of a compromise will it be to allow the use of choc2 switches?
